### Hello, friend!

If you take a careful look at my feed, you'll notice a Game of Life glider crawling through. It may look a bit odd 
at times, given that the feed is treated as a toroidal surface, so it will sometimes just be noticeable as some green dots 
on the first and last row.

This glider updates everyday at midnight. I wrote [an article on medium](https://lucasreta.medium.com/cligol-and-gifeegol-d5509a154bf6) 
detailing how this was achieved.
